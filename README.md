# weDocument

## ``weDocument is a documentation website that help programmers to code and also learn something``

###It is a initiative by a group of coders who thought that beginner coders should understand the documentation very easily and very meaningfully.
####So we have started this project called weDocument. It is made by programmers for the sake of other programmers.
